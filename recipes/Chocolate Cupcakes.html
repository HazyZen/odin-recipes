    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin pan
        with paper or foil liners.
      </li>
      <li>Sift together flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
      <li>
        Cream together sugar and butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy.
        Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the
        vanilla. Add flour mixture in two batches, alternating with milk; beat
        well. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers
        comes out clean, 15 to 17 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool
        before serving or frosting.
      </li>
