    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div class="top-section">
      <p>
        A cake pop is a form of <span>cake styled as a lollipop</span>. Cake
        crumbs are mixed with icing or chocolate, and formed into small spheres
        or cubes in the same way as cake balls, before being given a coating of
        icing, chocolate or other decorations and attached to lollipop sticks.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix (such as Betty Crocker®)</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>Lollipop sticks</li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) bag chocolate confectioners' coating</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking
        dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat cake mix, water, eggs, and vegetable oil together in a bowl using
        an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds; increase speed to medium
        and beat until batter is smooth, about 2 minutes more. Pour batter into
        the prepared baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center
        comes out clean, 28 to 33 minutes. Cool cake completely, at least 1
        hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Crumble cake into a large bowl and mix in cream cheese. Roll cake
        mixture into about 40 to 50 quarter-size balls. Insert a lollipop stick
        into each cake ball and arrange on a baking sheet; refrigerate until
        chilled, at least 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second
        intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip each cake ball into melted chocolate until coated. Arrange cake pops
        on a baking sheet to dry.
      </li>
    </ol>
